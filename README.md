# Global Shark Attacks | Data Cleaning

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to clean up as much of the Shark Attack database as possible with two additional constraints:   

-Not deleting any columns
-Final dataframe must contain over 20k rows
-This project is part of the Ironhack Madrid's Data Analytics bootcamp training programme.

# Steps

First, we start by checking the data type of each column, possible nulls and possible duplicate rows. 

Once we have made a first visualization of the database, we proceed to eliminate the duplicate rows and keep only the subset that does have data.Then, we will go column by column cleaning the dataframe and choosing the data we want to keep and the type of data we want the column to have.  

Finally, once we have the subset of data cleaned and the data analyzed, we add rows to adapt to the constraints imposed by our instructor  

# Final conclusions 

It has been a great job to be able to work all kinds of database cleaning techniques since the table provided had very little data quality and little utility, and decisions had to be made in order to obtain the final result.
